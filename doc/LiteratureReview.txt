Climate science has long used unsupervised classification methods to identify spatio-temporal patterns of variability in weather data. The “empirical orthogonal functions” (EOF) family of methods, derived from principal component analysis (PCA), are the most commonly used for this purpose (Hannachi et al 2007). In this case, we are specifically interested in identifying droughts at a scale which balances accuracy and precision, so a more tailored set of methods is needed. 

K-means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm, but it has downfalls that can be mitigated by X-means, which efficiently estimates the number of clusters in a dataset (Pelleg & Moore, 2000).  Tamene et al. used k-means and x-means to identify areas in Ethiopia with similar environmental and biophysical features called similar response units (SRUs).  They found that SRUs found areas with high similarity with lower levels of within-cluster of variability than the former classification of the region into agro-ecological zones (AEZs).  

Kalliolevo et al. (2022) used x-means to find the number of clusters within Finland’s biodiversity data.
Dinku et al. (2018) and Funk et al. (2015) both conduct a ground-truth validation of the CHIRPS dataset against weather station data, establishing that it is a reliable measure of precipitation across Eastern Africa. They find that error in the dataset over northern Ethiopia appears to be stochastic and decreasing over spatial and temporal scale; similarly, Black et al (2015) find that the coherence of satellite rainfall estimates improves with aggregation over space and / or time.
