This study provides a spatio-temporal analysis of drought patterns in the Amhara region of Ethiopia.  In order to identify whether a specific village is experiencing drought, rainfall data can be aggregated over that village using satellite rainfall estimates from the CHIRPS dataset.  Since this data is noisy and imprecise, it may be more beneficial to aggregate over a larger area, but not too large, since this would overlook important variations in weather patterns between different places.  Unsupervised learning can be used to determine which places have historically had similar precipitation patterns, while finding the optimal scale to cluster over.  I will use the X-means algorithm (Pelleg & Moore, 2000) which builds upon K-means by finding the optimal setting of K over the data.  From here, I will determine how successful the algorithm performed as defined by different indexes that measure inter-cluster similarity and intra-cluster variability.
