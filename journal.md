9/23 - changing my research question to be about predicting wildfires. This new research question will incoporate many variables and most likely use deep learning to generate a probability of wildfire occurrence on a specific day and in a specific location.
<br>
9/30 - a lot of studies I found predicted the cause of wildfires. An estimated 85-90% of these causes are from humans (like arson or fireworks) and the remainder are natural (such as lightning).  I will change my research to consist of two parts: 
<br>
<ol>
<li> Training a model to predict the cause of a wildfire, and use this to fill in missing/miscellaneous values in the dataset. The prediction will most likely be binary (whether the cause was human or not).  </li>
<li> Show the presence and strength of the wildfire and climate change positive feedback loop.  Wildfires contribute to carbon dioxide emissions which lead to high temperatures, which makes land prone to more wildfires. </li>
</ol>
